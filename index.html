    <h2>What Season The Dark Bomber came out in</h2>
    
    <p>The Dark bomber came out in the item shop in season 6. As one of the first cube related skins.  The Dark bomber has been in the item shop 3 times so far.  with that in mind until recently the dark bomber was considered a "OG" skin due to its rarity and the high skill level of the majority of the people who used it.</p>

    <h3>Acount selling</h3>
    
    <p>
      Epic games has made this attempt to stop account selling by bringing older skins back to the item shop.  The attempt was succesfull, proven by the fact that not nearly as many people buy accounts with rare skins in their lockers in fear that they will return to the item shop.  This attempt however, could go the other way.  The owners of these rare accounts might relize that if the rare skins come back then his account will be worthless and because of that try even harder to sell his or her's account.
